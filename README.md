- Convolutional Layers: Extract hierarchical features such as edges, textures, and shapes using multiple filters.
- Pooling Layers: Perform max-pooling to reduce spatial dimensions while preserving essential features.
- Fully Connected Layers: Process extracted features to output probabilities for disease and pest categories.
- Activation Functions: Used ReLU in hidden layers and Softmax for the output layer.
- Optimization: Trained using Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function.

#### - Machine Learning Models:
   Built and compared models using TensorFlow to achieve high accuracy in disease and pest detection.

#### - Image Processing:
   Preprocessed drone-captured images for noise reduction, feature extraction, and segmentation.

#### - Geospatial Mapping:
   Integrated GPS data to map disease occurrences and visualize affected areas.

The diagram illustrates the workflow for detecting crop diseases using drones and a CNN-based machine learning model. It consists of two main stages:

##### Image Processing:

Drones capture images of crops.
These images undergo preprocessing to enhance quality.
Feature extraction identifies patterns in the images, which are then classified to detect diseases.

##### Training Model:

- The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) processes the input images.
- Convolutional Layers to extract features like edges and textures.
- ReLU Layers to introduce non-linearity.
- Pooling Layers to reduce dimensions while retaining key features.
- Fully Connected Layers for classification results.
Finally, the identified disease areas can be targeted for spraying infected crops, providing a complete solution for agricultural disease management.
